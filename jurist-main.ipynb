      "Text: The Tunis Court of Appeal Specializing in Financial Corruption Cases has issued arrest warrants against Tunisian businessman and former MP Lotfi Ali, as well as the former CEO of the Gafsa Phosphate Company (CPG), Romdhane Souid, TAPreportedSaturday. Speaking to TAP, Deputy Attorney General Sonia Moussaoui confirmed the issue of the arrest warrants, and in addition to naming Souid and Ali, identified three additional defendants; Slim Feriani, who served as the Minister of Industry under the 2016-2020 Chahed government, as well as Mouldi Ali, Lotfi’s brother, and Abdelwaheb Hfaïedh. Per Moussaoui’s statement, the warrants were issued in connection with alleged corruption crimes, involving a contract for the extraction and transport of phosphates between Souid, Ali, and the three other defendants. Phosphate, used in fertilizers, is often regarded as the driving force of Tunisia’s mining sector. However, it has also been a frequent source of social tension and routinely faces allegations of corruption. In August 2021, a Tunisian judgebanned12 government officials from traveling due to their suspected involvement in corrupt activities relating to the mining and transport of phosphates; these individuals were later arrested and charged with corruption crimes. Over the years, President Kais Saied has vowed to crack down on corruption in the industry, given the sector’s significantcontributionto Tunisia’s GDP (phosphate mining accounts for 4% of GDP and 15% of exports). This crackdown extends to other sectors as well; more recently, the Tunisian Federation of Insurance Companies (TFIC)announcedthe establishment of the Agency to Combat Fraud and Scams (ALFA) in the insurance sector, in a bid to tackle growing instances of fraud, scams and corruption within the industry.\n",

      "Text: Vice President of the Tigray Interim Administration, General Tadesse Woreda,statedSaturday that the Interim Administration will take tough measures to ensure that the increasing security threats and crimes in Tigray are addressed and controlled. In line with this announcement, the Tigray Interim Administrationreleaseda statement revealing a new initiative to combat crime in the region. In his press briefing on the escalating security concerns in Tigray, General Tadesse said that the crimes currently plaguing the region cannot be addressed through conventional policing measures. He stressed that tackling this crisis will be a top priority for their security forces and all law enforcement agencies, who will work tirelessly to regain control of the situation. General Tadesse further underscored that regardless of whether the perpetrators are government officials, security personnel, or investors, they will take all necessary steps to address and resolve the mounting security threats and criminal activities in Tigray. He concluded by assuring that this initiative will remain steadfast in the face of any challenges that may arise along the way. The Interim Administration’s initiative follows extensive investigations conducted by committees formed after the November 2022Pretoria Peace Agreement, a treaty signed between the government of Ethiopia and the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) to a establish “permanent cessation of hostilities” and end the Tigray War. According to the statement, the administration has begun detaining suspects involved in serious crimes that have been plaguing the region. The communiqué emphasized that the primary goal of this initiative is to eradicate illegal activities and bring criminals to justice. Furthermore, the administration reported that authorities have already started arresting individuals involved in major crimes, specifically mentioning illegal iron ore smuggling as one of the targeted activities. Serious crimes andhuman rights violationscontinue to plague the Tigray region. Human Rights Watch (HRW)reportsthat even after the November 2, 2022ceasefire agreement, local authorities and Amhara forces have continued to forcibly remove Tigrayans from Western Tigray Zone. HRW describes this as an “ethnic cleansing campaign” that has been ongoing since the outbreak of armed conflict in November 2020. According to the organization, this campaign has allegedly involvedwar crimesandcrimes against humanity, includingarbitrary detention, torture, and forced deportation of Tigrayans. Compounding these concerns, twenty-seven Tigray-based civil society organizations recentlyissuedan urgent call to action to address the dramatic increase ingender-based violenceagainst women in the region. These groups have strongly criticized the Tigray Transitional Government’s security and justice institutions for failing to prevent these crimes and hold perpetrators accountable. Selamawit Giday, who heads the Rise and Shine Women’s Protection Center, one of the organizations involved, emphasized the profound societal impact of this violence. She urged the Tigray regional administration to ensure that its security and justice institutions enforce the law with integrity, impartiality and accountability. The gravity of the situation is illustrated by a Mekelle city policereportcited by DW, which revealed disturbing statistics: in the past eleven months alone, 12 women were murdered, 80 raped, 10 kidnapped and 178 faced attempted murder.\n",

      "Text: The Polish parliamentrejectedFriday a draft bill to decriminalize consensual abortion assistance, according to reproductive rights activists. The initiative was part of a group-bill proposal, which underwent an extensivedebateearly April in the Sejm (the Polish Parliament) and wasprotestedagainst by thousands of people. The refusal to decriminalize consensual abortion assistance was heavily criticized by the Center for Reproductive Rights via a statement, considering abortion criminalizing laws as the cause for the creation of a climate of fear, as well as placing women’s lives at risk. Further, the organization considered Friday’s decision as a missed opportunity to “alleviate the immense suffering endured by thousands of women and girls in Poland”. When it comes to abortion, Poland has currently one of the most restrictive legislations in Europe under article 152 of the Criminal Code. This leads to a large number of doctors refusing to assist women who want to terminate a pregnancy, even when the circumstances are legal. Reacting to the discussion approval of the four bills by the parliament, Amnesty International hasstatedthat Poland needs to urgently amend their abortion law which endangers lives, jeopardizes health and contravenes the country’s international and European human rights obligations. The Poland Constitutional Court took a controversial decision in 2020, when it decided to declare abortion in cases of fetal abnormalities as unconstitutional. Ever since, the decision has been heavily criticized by human rights organizations, among which Amnesty International considers it “as a coordinated systematic wave of attacks on women’s human rights by Polish lawmakers.”\n",

      "Text: US President Biden on Friday signed intolawthePromoting a Resolution to the Tibet-China Dispute Act.The bill declares Congress’s position that Tibetans have a “religious, cultural, linguistic, and historical identity” distinct from the Chinese people which the Chinese government undermines by its claims and penalizes by its rights violations of Tibetans. Congress found the Chinese government to be violating its obligations under international law, most notably violating the right of self-determination for Tibetans. It described the Chinese government’s rights violations of the Tibetan people to be systematic and pointed to Tibetanopposition and resistance. Congress said urged the Chinese government to stop its alleged disinformation campaign against Tibet and the Tibetans, its violations of international law, and its unwillingness to engage in meaningful negotiations with Tibetan leaders. Congress also declared its aim to restart diplomacy between Chinese and Tibetan leaders that started in 2002 and ended in January 2010 without a successful resolution. The bill implements Congress’s motives in resolving the Tibet-China dispute by statutorily defining Tibet and amending itsTibetan Policy Act of 2002. The bill defined Tibet as the Tibet Autonomous Region and the areas in China the Chinese government in 2018 recognized as “Tibetan Autonomous.” It amended the Tibetan Policy Act of 2002 by adding that the President must annually send reports tocongressional committees on “[US] efforts to counter disinformation about Tibet from the [Chinese government] and the Chinese Communist Party” and the Special Coordinator must “work with relevant bureaus … to ensure that [US government] statements and documents” fight the Chinese government’s disinformation campaign against Tibet and Tibetans. Responding to the bill’s passage into US law, the Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson issued the followingremarks: The [bill] violates the US government’s long-held position and commitments and the basic norms governing international relations, grossly interferes in China’s domestic affairs, undermines China’s interests, and sends a severely wrong signal to the “Tibet independence” forces … If the US continues down the wrong path, China will take resolute measures to firmly defend its sovereignty, security and development interests.\n",

      "Text: Chinese and Russian naval forces began a joint exercise at a southern Chinese military port, the spokesperson for China’s Ministry of National Defense, Zhang Xiaogang,announcedFriday. The annual “Maritime Joint-2024” exercise, agreed upon by both nations, is taking place near Zhanjiang until mid-July. Its stated objectives include demonstrating the partners’ ability to address maritime security threats, maintain regional stability, and deepen their strategic partnership. During the opening ceremony, military officials from both nationssaidthe joint exercises bolstered cooperation and elevated professional standards. Following the ceremony, China’s state broadcaster CCTVreportedthat the exercises will unfold in multiple phases. Initially, the two sides will engage in desktop simulations and tactical coordination. Subsequently, Chinese and Russian naval fleets will conduct joint exercises in the sea and airspace near Zhanjiang. These operations will encompass a wide range of activities, including anchorage defense, joint reconnaissance and early warning, search and rescue missions, anti-submarine warfare, anti-missile operations, and air defense maneuvers. Additionally, the forces will conduct training sessions focused on the practical application of weaponry. This naval cooperation unfolds against a backdrop of mounting tensions between China and NATO allies. At their July 9-11 Washington Summit, NATO members designated China as a “decisive enabler” of Russia’s actions in Ukraine, citing their “no-holds-barred partnership” and China’s support for the Russian defense industry. The alliance also voiced concerns about Beijing’s nuclear arsenal and space capabilities. The finalcommuniqué, endorsed by all 32 NATO members, clearly signals that China is becoming a focal point for the military alliance: The People’s Republic of China’s (PRC) stated ambitions and coercive policies continue to challenge our interests, security and values. The deepening strategic partnership between Russia and the PRC and their mutually reinforcing attempts to undercut and reshape the rules-based international order, are a cause for profound concern. We are confronted by hybrid, cyber, space, and other threats and malicious activities from state and non-state actors. In response, ChinaaccusedNATO of pursuing security at the expense of others and cautioned against introducing “chaos” to Asia, while reiterating its neutrality on the Ukraine conflict. Despite these tensions, China’s Defense Ministry recently disclosed that Chinese and Russian naval vessels had completed their fourth joint maritime patrol in the western and northern Pacific Ocean. The Ministrystressedthat this patrol neither targeted any third party nor bore any relation to current international or regional situations.\n",

      "Text: The Philippine Senateorderedthe arrest of a small-town mayor on Thursday who failed to attend hearings probing her suspected connections to Chinese criminal networks. The Senate president signed the arrest order, authorizing the Senate’s sergeant-at-arms to detain Mayor Alice Guo, also known as Guo Hua Ping, after she missed a second consecutive hearing on Wednesday, citing stress as her reason. Guo’s small farm town of Bamban in the Central Luzon area of the Philippines was thrust into the national spotlight in March when authorities raided a local Philippine Offshore Gaming Operator (POGO) compound, uncovering scams allegedly operating out of a facility part-owned by the mayor. The discovery prompted the Senate to launch a vigorous investigation in May, in which officials rescued hundreds of trafficked workers and seized equipment used for scamming from the facility. The POGO sector emerged in the Philippines in 2016 and has since experienced explosive growth, with operators leveraging the country’s liberal gaming laws to serve customers in China, where gambling remains prohibited. Her family background also came under scrutiny after the March operation. Guo has insisted that she is a Filipino citizen but the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) said her fingerprints matched those of a Chinese national who entered the country as a teenager. The SenaterepostedSenator Win Gatchalian’s video on a local news network disputing Mayor Guo’s educational records. The video claims that Guo was born in Fujian, China, citing an alien certificate of registration from when she entered the Philippines at age 14. Senator Gatchalian alsocitedthe NBI’s findings during a Senate hearing showing Guo’s fingerprints matching those of Guo Hua Ping, who possesses a Chinese birth certificate and details about her parentage. The Chinese embassy has not commented on the issue. Guo has staunchly denied any criminal affiliations and asserts that she is a natural-born citizen of the Philippines. In aletterto the Senate, she claims to be the target of “malicious accusations.” President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.expressedperplexity about Guo’s background to reporters in May, stating, “No one knows her. We wonder where she came from. That’s why we are investigating this, in collaboration with the Bureau of Immigration, to address the uncertainties surrounding her citizenship.”\n",

      "Text: The Supreme Court of Pakistan overturned on Saturday the conviction of ex-PM Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi Saturday for violating the country’s marriage laws in 2018,accordingto Khan’s lawyer, Naeem Panthuja, who celebrated on social media. Khan and his wife weresentencedto seven years for violating the law by marrying before the passage of the prescribed three-month “iddah” period after Khan’s wife’s previous divorce. The couple made previousattemptsto appeal the conviction, but these were rejected. At trial in February, the prosecutionassertedKhan and his wife violated Islamic law, which says that a woman must wait three months before re-marrying. This is known as the “iddah” period and is a requirement under Pakistan’s Islamic family law. The former First Spouse was previously married, and her ex-husband Khawar Maneka claimed they divorced in November 2017, less than three months before Bibi married Khan in January 2018. She has, however, said they divorced in August 2017. Both Khan and Bibi denied they violated the law, calling the charges “baseless” and “politically motivated,” ahead of the February 8 parliamentary elections in Pakistan, from which Khan had already been disqualified owing to legal convictions. The unlawful marriage case was not the only recent legal battle fought by the former Prime Minister. Khan is reportedly implicated in more than150legal proceedings, facing accusations that span instigating violence during the nationwide unrest following hisarrestin May 2023 to further charges of corruption. In August 2023, Khan was convicted and sentenced to 14 years in prison in theToshakhanacorruption case, which alleged Khan sold state gifts. Additionally, Khan was convicted and sentenced to 10 years in January in the “cypher” case, in which Khan accused the US of trying to oust him based on a secret diplomatic cable. Subsequently, he shared details, violating secrecy laws, which led to his conviction. International NGOs and other groups have expressed concern about the use of “lawfare” against Khan and other political opposition in the country. In July, the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary DetentionrecommendedKhan’s release. The recommendation was dismissed by the Pakistani government.\n",

      "Text: Japan’s Defense Ministryannounceddisciplinary action on Friday against 218 members of the ministry and the Self-Defense Forces (SDF) for various misconducts, including mishandling classified materials. Among those disciplined, 11 officials were dismissed, two were demoted, 83 were suspended, 14 received pay cuts, and seven were formally reprimanded. The remaining personnel received admonishments or warnings. The investigation uncovered several inappropriate activities, such as mishandling classified information, fraudulent receipt of allowances, and power harassment. Notably, 58 cases involved the improper handling of confidential information within the Ground, Maritime, and Air Self-Defense Forces. Crew members on several Maritime Self-Defense Force (MSDF) destroyers shared sensitive information with unqualified colleagues. Additionally, 62 MSDF personnel, including senior members, fraudulently claimed allowances for diving training and duty, amounting to approximately 43 million yen ($270,000). Over 20 MSDF members and officials improperly consumed free meals in SDF base cafeterias. Power harassment was also a significant issue, with three ministry officials at the director level or higher accused of making intimidating remarks to subordinates, causing psychological distress. In response, Defense Minister Minoru Kihara emphasized the need for reform within the MSDF. Consequently, Akira Saito, currently the Self Defense Fleet commander in chief, willreplaceMSDF Chief of Staff Admiral RyoSakaion July 19. The scandal emerges as Japan seeks closer militarycooperationwith the United States, Australia, the United Kingdom, and other Western partners amid regional threats from China and North Korea. Kiharaacknowledgedthe significant damage to public trust and vowed to implement preventive measures to protect sensitive information and maintain international confidence in Japan’s defense capabilities.\n",

      "Text: The Constitutional Court of Latviaruledagainst a challenge to a law that converted Russian-language schools to Latvian. It stated that the decision to make the school language Latvian was valid under the country’s legal framework and international commitments. Latvia, a former member of the Soviet Union, gained its independence and officially became a country in 1991. While it has a sizable Russian-speaking population, the majority of the population speaks Latvian. Article 4 of theConstitution of Latviaalso recognizes Latvian as the official language of the nation. Additionally, Article 114 gives the right to ethnic minorities to preserve their language. TheEducation Law of 1998and theGeneral Education Lawof 2000 required all public schools to use Latvian as the primary language of teaching, while some private institutions choose to teach in Russian. In 2018, theAmendment to General Education Law Actwas passed, which made teaching in Latvian compulsory in all educational institutions, including private institutions. This created controversy among the Russian speaking population, and opponents of the reform filed apetitionin 2023 against the act, alleging it to be violation of the right to obtain general education in a minority language. The original court upheld the act and the Constitutional Court was hearing an appeal. A 2020reportby the Venice Commission, an advisory body of the Council of Europe, examined these amendments. It concluded that while the laws were in compliance with international regulations, the government of Latvia should consider a framework more inclusive of minorities. The ruling comes amid as Latvia has passed other laws that impact the Russian-speaking community, including regulations whichrequireRussian residents to pass a language exam. Latvia alsoclosedborder crossing points with Russia in October 2023, for what it cited as security reasons.\n",

The hospital is located in Kyiv and is the largest children’s hospital in Ukraine. It houses the only oncological laboratory in the country. Although hundreds of individuals were evacuated ahead of the strike, some were still in the hospital when it happened. At least 42 civilians were killed, and 190 injured, with the evaluation still ongoing. In addition to the human impact, the attack struck at some of the most vital medical facilities of the country, weakening Ukraine’s capacity to provide quality medical treatment to patients. Many have condemned Russia’s actions as war crimes. The executive director of the Human Rights Watch, Tirana Hassan,saidthat “attacks directed at medical facilities are war crimes under international humanitarian law, and the strike that hit Okhmatdyt children’s hospital should be investigated as a potential war crime.” Further, the director of Okhmatdyt Hospital, Dr. Volodymyr Zhovnir,saidthat “striking a children’s hospital, where children are treated for cancer and other heavy diseases, is not just a war crime, it is far beyond the limits of humanity.” Russia hasdenied any involvementin the strike and said that the strike was a result of Ukrainian missiles veering off course. The ICC ismandatedto investigate and try “individuals charged with the gravest crimes of concern to the international community: genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity and the crime of aggression.”\n",

Speaking to TAP, Deputy Attorney General Sonia Moussaoui confirmed the issue of the arrest warrants, and in addition to naming Souid and Ali, identified three additional defendants; Slim Feriani, who served as the Minister of Industry under the 2016-2020 Chahed government, as well as Mouldi Ali, Lotfi\\u2019s brother, and Abdelwaheb Hfa\\u00efedh. Per Moussaoui\\u2019s statement, the warrants were issued in connection with alleged corruption crimes, involving a contract for the extraction and transport of phosphates between Souid, Ali, and the three other defendants. Phosphate, used in fertilizers, is often regarded as the driving force of Tunisia\\u2019s mining sector. However, it has also been a frequent source of social tension and routinely faces allegations of corruption. In August 2021, a Tunisian judgebanned12 government officials from traveling due to their suspected involvement in corrupt activities relating to the mining and transport of phosphates; these individuals were later arrested and charged with corruption crimes. Over the years, President Kais Saied has vowed to crack down on corruption in the industry, given the sector\\u2019s significantcontributionto Tunisia\\u2019s GDP (phosphate mining accounts for 4% of GDP and 15% of exports). This crackdown extends to other sectors as well; more recently, the Tunisian Federation of Insurance Companies (TFIC)announcedthe establishment of the Agency to Combat Fraud and Scams (ALFA) in the insurance sector, in a bid to tackle growing instances of fraud, scams and corruption within the industry.\"\n",

In line with this announcement, the Tigray Interim Administrationreleaseda statement revealing a new initiative to combat crime in the region. In his press briefing on the escalating security concerns in Tigray, General Tadesse said that the crimes currently plaguing the region cannot be addressed through conventional policing measures. He stressed that tackling this crisis will be a top priority for their security forces and all law enforcement agencies, who will work tirelessly to regain control of the situation. General Tadesse further underscored that regardless of whether the perpetrators are government officials, security personnel, or investors, they will take all necessary steps to address and resolve the mounting security threats and criminal activities in Tigray. He concluded by assuring that this initiative will remain steadfast in the face of any challenges that may arise along the way. The Interim Administration\\u2019s initiative follows extensive investigations conducted by committees formed after the November 2022Pretoria Peace Agreement, a treaty signed between the government of Ethiopia and the Tigray People\\u2019s Liberation Front (TPLF) to a establish \\u201cpermanent cessation of hostilities\\u201d and end the Tigray War. According to the statement, the administration has begun detaining suspects involved in serious crimes that have been plaguing the region. The communiqu\\u00e9 emphasized that the primary goal of this initiative is to eradicate illegal activities and bring criminals to justice. Furthermore, the administration reported that authorities have already started arresting individuals involved in major crimes, specifically mentioning illegal iron ore smuggling as one of the targeted activities. Serious crimes andhuman rights violationscontinue to plague the Tigray region. Human Rights Watch (HRW)reportsthat even after the November 2, 2022ceasefire agreement, local authorities and Amhara forces have continued to forcibly remove Tigrayans from Western Tigray Zone. HRW describes this as an \\u201cethnic cleansing campaign\\u201d that has been ongoing since the outbreak of armed conflict in November 2020. According to the organization, this campaign has allegedly involvedwar crimesandcrimes against humanity, includingarbitrary detention, torture, and forced deportation of Tigrayans. Compounding these concerns, twenty-seven Tigray-based civil society organizations recentlyissuedan urgent call to action to address the dramatic increase ingender-based violenceagainst women in the region. These groups have strongly criticized the Tigray Transitional Government\\u2019s security and justice institutions for failing to prevent these crimes and hold perpetrators accountable. Selamawit Giday, who heads the Rise and Shine Women\\u2019s Protection Center, one of the organizations involved, emphasized the profound societal impact of this violence. She urged the Tigray regional administration to ensure that its security and justice institutions enforce the law with integrity, impartiality and accountability. The gravity of the situation is illustrated by a Mekelle city policereportcited by DW, which revealed disturbing statistics: in the past eleven months alone, 12 women were murdered, 80 raped, 10 kidnapped and 178 faced attempted murder.\"\n",

       "  'content': 'The Tunis Court of Appeal Specializing in Financial Corruption Cases has issued arrest warrants against Tunisian businessman and former MP Lotfi Ali, as well as the former CEO of the Gafsa Phosphate Company (CPG), Romdhane Souid, TAPreportedSaturday. Speaking to TAP, Deputy Attorney General Sonia Moussaoui confirmed the issue of the arrest warrants, and in addition to naming Souid and Ali, identified three additional defendants; Slim Feriani, who served as the Minister of Industry under the 2016-2020 Chahed government, as well as Mouldi Ali, Lotfi’s brother, and Abdelwaheb Hfaïedh. Per Moussaoui’s statement, the warrants were issued in connection with alleged corruption crimes, involving a contract for the extraction and transport of phosphates between Souid, Ali, and the three other defendants. Phosphate, used in fertilizers, is often regarded as the driving force of Tunisia’s mining sector. However, it has also been a frequent source of social tension and routinely faces allegations of corruption. In August 2021, a Tunisian judgebanned12 government officials from traveling due to their suspected involvement in corrupt activities relating to the mining and transport of phosphates; these individuals were later arrested and charged with corruption crimes. Over the years, President Kais Saied has vowed to crack down on corruption in the industry, given the sector’s significantcontributionto Tunisia’s GDP (phosphate mining accounts for 4% of GDP and 15% of exports). This crackdown extends to other sectors as well; more recently, the Tunisian Federation of Insurance Companies (TFIC)announcedthe establishment of the Agency to Combat Fraud and Scams (ALFA) in the insurance sector, in a bid to tackle growing instances of fraud, scams and corruption within the industry.',\n",

       "  'content': 'Vice President of the Tigray Interim Administration, General Tadesse Woreda,statedSaturday that the Interim Administration will take tough measures to ensure that the increasing security threats and crimes in Tigray are addressed and controlled. In line with this announcement, the Tigray Interim Administrationreleaseda statement revealing a new initiative to combat crime in the region. In his press briefing on the escalating security concerns in Tigray, General Tadesse said that the crimes currently plaguing the region cannot be addressed through conventional policing measures. He stressed that tackling this crisis will be a top priority for their security forces and all law enforcement agencies, who will work tirelessly to regain control of the situation. General Tadesse further underscored that regardless of whether the perpetrators are government officials, security personnel, or investors, they will take all necessary steps to address and resolve the mounting security threats and criminal activities in Tigray. He concluded by assuring that this initiative will remain steadfast in the face of any challenges that may arise along the way. The Interim Administration’s initiative follows extensive investigations conducted by committees formed after the November 2022Pretoria Peace Agreement, a treaty signed between the government of Ethiopia and the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) to a establish “permanent cessation of hostilities” and end the Tigray War. According to the statement, the administration has begun detaining suspects involved in serious crimes that have been plaguing the region. The communiqué emphasized that the primary goal of this initiative is to eradicate illegal activities and bring criminals to justice. Furthermore, the administration reported that authorities have already started arresting individuals involved in major crimes, specifically mentioning illegal iron ore smuggling as one of the targeted activities. Serious crimes andhuman rights violationscontinue to plague the Tigray region. Human Rights Watch (HRW)reportsthat even after the November 2, 2022ceasefire agreement, local authorities and Amhara forces have continued to forcibly remove Tigrayans from Western Tigray Zone. HRW describes this as an “ethnic cleansing campaign” that has been ongoing since the outbreak of armed conflict in November 2020. According to the organization, this campaign has allegedly involvedwar crimesandcrimes against humanity, includingarbitrary detention, torture, and forced deportation of Tigrayans. Compounding these concerns, twenty-seven Tigray-based civil society organizations recentlyissuedan urgent call to action to address the dramatic increase ingender-based violenceagainst women in the region. These groups have strongly criticized the Tigray Transitional Government’s security and justice institutions for failing to prevent these crimes and hold perpetrators accountable. Selamawit Giday, who heads the Rise and Shine Women’s Protection Center, one of the organizations involved, emphasized the profound societal impact of this violence. She urged the Tigray regional administration to ensure that its security and justice institutions enforce the law with integrity, impartiality and accountability. The gravity of the situation is illustrated by a Mekelle city policereportcited by DW, which revealed disturbing statistics: in the past eleven months alone, 12 women were murdered, 80 raped, 10 kidnapped and 178 faced attempted murder.',\n",

       "  'content': 'The Polish parliamentrejectedFriday a draft bill to decriminalize consensual abortion assistance, according to reproductive rights activists. The initiative was part of a group-bill proposal, which underwent an extensivedebateearly April in the Sejm (the Polish Parliament) and wasprotestedagainst by thousands of people. The refusal to decriminalize consensual abortion assistance was heavily criticized by the Center for Reproductive Rights via a statement, considering abortion criminalizing laws as the cause for the creation of a climate of fear, as well as placing women’s lives at risk. Further, the organization considered Friday’s decision as a missed opportunity to “alleviate the immense suffering endured by thousands of women and girls in Poland”. When it comes to abortion, Poland has currently one of the most restrictive legislations in Europe under article 152 of the Criminal Code. This leads to a large number of doctors refusing to assist women who want to terminate a pregnancy, even when the circumstances are legal. Reacting to the discussion approval of the four bills by the parliament, Amnesty International hasstatedthat Poland needs to urgently amend their abortion law which endangers lives, jeopardizes health and contravenes the country’s international and European human rights obligations. The Poland Constitutional Court took a controversial decision in 2020, when it decided to declare abortion in cases of fetal abnormalities as unconstitutional. Ever since, the decision has been heavily criticized by human rights organizations, among which Amnesty International considers it “as a coordinated systematic wave of attacks on women’s human rights by Polish lawmakers.”',\n",

       "  'content': 'US President Biden on Friday signed intolawthePromoting a Resolution to the Tibet-China Dispute Act.The bill declares Congress’s position that Tibetans have a “religious, cultural, linguistic, and historical identity” distinct from the Chinese people which the Chinese government undermines by its claims and penalizes by its rights violations of Tibetans. Congress found the Chinese government to be violating its obligations under international law, most notably violating the right of self-determination for Tibetans. It described the Chinese government’s rights violations of the Tibetan people to be systematic and pointed to Tibetanopposition and resistance. Congress said urged the Chinese government to stop its alleged disinformation campaign against Tibet and the Tibetans, its violations of international law, and its unwillingness to engage in meaningful negotiations with Tibetan leaders. Congress also declared its aim to restart diplomacy between Chinese and Tibetan leaders that started in 2002 and ended in January 2010 without a successful resolution. The bill implements Congress’s motives in resolving the Tibet-China dispute by statutorily defining Tibet and amending itsTibetan Policy Act of 2002. The bill defined Tibet as the Tibet Autonomous Region and the areas in China the Chinese government in 2018 recognized as “Tibetan Autonomous.” It amended the Tibetan Policy Act of 2002 by adding that the President must annually send reports tocongressional committees on “[US] efforts to counter disinformation about Tibet from the [Chinese government] and the Chinese Communist Party” and the Special Coordinator must “work with relevant bureaus … to ensure that [US government] statements and documents” fight the Chinese government’s disinformation campaign against Tibet and Tibetans. Responding to the bill’s passage into US law, the Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson issued the followingremarks: The [bill] violates the US government’s long-held position and commitments and the basic norms governing international relations, grossly interferes in China’s domestic affairs, undermines China’s interests, and sends a severely wrong signal to the “Tibet independence” forces … If the US continues down the wrong path, China will take resolute measures to firmly defend its sovereignty, security and development interests.',\n",

       "  'content': 'Chinese and Russian naval forces began a joint exercise at a southern Chinese military port, the spokesperson for China’s Ministry of National Defense, Zhang Xiaogang,announcedFriday. The annual “Maritime Joint-2024” exercise, agreed upon by both nations, is taking place near Zhanjiang until mid-July. Its stated objectives include demonstrating the partners’ ability to address maritime security threats, maintain regional stability, and deepen their strategic partnership. During the opening ceremony, military officials from both nationssaidthe joint exercises bolstered cooperation and elevated professional standards. Following the ceremony, China’s state broadcaster CCTVreportedthat the exercises will unfold in multiple phases. Initially, the two sides will engage in desktop simulations and tactical coordination. Subsequently, Chinese and Russian naval fleets will conduct joint exercises in the sea and airspace near Zhanjiang. These operations will encompass a wide range of activities, including anchorage defense, joint reconnaissance and early warning, search and rescue missions, anti-submarine warfare, anti-missile operations, and air defense maneuvers. Additionally, the forces will conduct training sessions focused on the practical application of weaponry. This naval cooperation unfolds against a backdrop of mounting tensions between China and NATO allies. At their July 9-11 Washington Summit, NATO members designated China as a “decisive enabler” of Russia’s actions in Ukraine, citing their “no-holds-barred partnership” and China’s support for the Russian defense industry. The alliance also voiced concerns about Beijing’s nuclear arsenal and space capabilities. The finalcommuniqué, endorsed by all 32 NATO members, clearly signals that China is becoming a focal point for the military alliance: The People’s Republic of China’s (PRC) stated ambitions and coercive policies continue to challenge our interests, security and values. The deepening strategic partnership between Russia and the PRC and their mutually reinforcing attempts to undercut and reshape the rules-based international order, are a cause for profound concern. We are confronted by hybrid, cyber, space, and other threats and malicious activities from state and non-state actors. In response, ChinaaccusedNATO of pursuing security at the expense of others and cautioned against introducing “chaos” to Asia, while reiterating its neutrality on the Ukraine conflict. Despite these tensions, China’s Defense Ministry recently disclosed that Chinese and Russian naval vessels had completed their fourth joint maritime patrol in the western and northern Pacific Ocean. The Ministrystressedthat this patrol neither targeted any third party nor bore any relation to current international or regional situations.',\n",

       "  'content': 'The Philippine Senateorderedthe arrest of a small-town mayor on Thursday who failed to attend hearings probing her suspected connections to Chinese criminal networks. The Senate president signed the arrest order, authorizing the Senate’s sergeant-at-arms to detain Mayor Alice Guo, also known as Guo Hua Ping, after she missed a second consecutive hearing on Wednesday, citing stress as her reason. Guo’s small farm town of Bamban in the Central Luzon area of the Philippines was thrust into the national spotlight in March when authorities raided a local Philippine Offshore Gaming Operator (POGO) compound, uncovering scams allegedly operating out of a facility part-owned by the mayor. The discovery prompted the Senate to launch a vigorous investigation in May, in which officials rescued hundreds of trafficked workers and seized equipment used for scamming from the facility. The POGO sector emerged in the Philippines in 2016 and has since experienced explosive growth, with operators leveraging the country’s liberal gaming laws to serve customers in China, where gambling remains prohibited. Her family background also came under scrutiny after the March operation. Guo has insisted that she is a Filipino citizen but the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) said her fingerprints matched those of a Chinese national who entered the country as a teenager. The SenaterepostedSenator Win Gatchalian’s video on a local news network disputing Mayor Guo’s educational records. The video claims that Guo was born in Fujian, China, citing an alien certificate of registration from when she entered the Philippines at age 14. Senator Gatchalian alsocitedthe NBI’s findings during a Senate hearing showing Guo’s fingerprints matching those of Guo Hua Ping, who possesses a Chinese birth certificate and details about her parentage. The Chinese embassy has not commented on the issue. Guo has staunchly denied any criminal affiliations and asserts that she is a natural-born citizen of the Philippines. In aletterto the Senate, she claims to be the target of “malicious accusations.” President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.expressedperplexity about Guo’s background to reporters in May, stating, “No one knows her. We wonder where she came from. That’s why we are investigating this, in collaboration with the Bureau of Immigration, to address the uncertainties surrounding her citizenship.”',\n",

       "  'content': 'The Supreme Court of Pakistan overturned on Saturday the conviction of ex-PM Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi Saturday for violating the country’s marriage laws in 2018,accordingto Khan’s lawyer, Naeem Panthuja, who celebrated on social media. Khan and his wife weresentencedto seven years for violating the law by marrying before the passage of the prescribed three-month “iddah” period after Khan’s wife’s previous divorce. The couple made previousattemptsto appeal the conviction, but these were rejected. At trial in February, the prosecutionassertedKhan and his wife violated Islamic law, which says that a woman must wait three months before re-marrying. This is known as the “iddah” period and is a requirement under Pakistan’s Islamic family law. The former First Spouse was previously married, and her ex-husband Khawar Maneka claimed they divorced in November 2017, less than three months before Bibi married Khan in January 2018. She has, however, said they divorced in August 2017. Both Khan and Bibi denied they violated the law, calling the charges “baseless” and “politically motivated,” ahead of the February 8 parliamentary elections in Pakistan, from which Khan had already been disqualified owing to legal convictions. The unlawful marriage case was not the only recent legal battle fought by the former Prime Minister. Khan is reportedly implicated in more than150legal proceedings, facing accusations that span instigating violence during the nationwide unrest following hisarrestin May 2023 to further charges of corruption. In August 2023, Khan was convicted and sentenced to 14 years in prison in theToshakhanacorruption case, which alleged Khan sold state gifts. Additionally, Khan was convicted and sentenced to 10 years in January in the “cypher” case, in which Khan accused the US of trying to oust him based on a secret diplomatic cable. Subsequently, he shared details, violating secrecy laws, which led to his conviction. International NGOs and other groups have expressed concern about the use of “lawfare” against Khan and other political opposition in the country. In July, the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary DetentionrecommendedKhan’s release. The recommendation was dismissed by the Pakistani government.',\n",

       "  'content': 'Japan’s Defense Ministryannounceddisciplinary action on Friday against 218 members of the ministry and the Self-Defense Forces (SDF) for various misconducts, including mishandling classified materials. Among those disciplined, 11 officials were dismissed, two were demoted, 83 were suspended, 14 received pay cuts, and seven were formally reprimanded. The remaining personnel received admonishments or warnings. The investigation uncovered several inappropriate activities, such as mishandling classified information, fraudulent receipt of allowances, and power harassment. Notably, 58 cases involved the improper handling of confidential information within the Ground, Maritime, and Air Self-Defense Forces. Crew members on several Maritime Self-Defense Force (MSDF) destroyers shared sensitive information with unqualified colleagues. Additionally, 62 MSDF personnel, including senior members, fraudulently claimed allowances for diving training and duty, amounting to approximately 43 million yen ($270,000). Over 20 MSDF members and officials improperly consumed free meals in SDF base cafeterias. Power harassment was also a significant issue, with three ministry officials at the director level or higher accused of making intimidating remarks to subordinates, causing psychological distress. In response, Defense Minister Minoru Kihara emphasized the need for reform within the MSDF. Consequently, Akira Saito, currently the Self Defense Fleet commander in chief, willreplaceMSDF Chief of Staff Admiral RyoSakaion July 19. The scandal emerges as Japan seeks closer militarycooperationwith the United States, Australia, the United Kingdom, and other Western partners amid regional threats from China and North Korea. Kiharaacknowledgedthe significant damage to public trust and vowed to implement preventive measures to protect sensitive information and maintain international confidence in Japan’s defense capabilities.',\n",

       "  'content': 'The Constitutional Court of Latviaruledagainst a challenge to a law that\\xa0converted Russian-language schools to Latvian. It stated that the decision to make the school language Latvian was valid under the country’s legal framework and international commitments. Latvia, a former member of the Soviet Union, gained its independence and officially became a country in 1991. While it has a sizable Russian-speaking population, the majority of the population speaks Latvian. Article 4 of theConstitution of Latviaalso recognizes Latvian as the official language of the nation. Additionally, Article 114 gives the right to ethnic minorities to preserve their language. TheEducation Law of 1998and theGeneral Education Lawof 2000 required all public schools to use Latvian as the primary language of teaching, while some private institutions choose to teach in Russian. In 2018, theAmendment to General Education Law Actwas passed, which made teaching in Latvian compulsory in all educational institutions, including private institutions. This created controversy among the Russian speaking population, and opponents of the reform filed apetitionin 2023 against the act, alleging it to be violation of the right to obtain general education in a minority language. The original court upheld the act and the Constitutional Court was hearing an appeal. A 2020reportby the Venice Commission, an advisory body of the Council of Europe, examined these amendments. It concluded that while the laws were in compliance with international regulations, the government of Latvia should consider a framework more inclusive of minorities. The ruling comes amid as Latvia has passed other laws that impact the Russian-speaking community, including regulations whichrequireRussian residents to pass a language exam.\\xa0Latvia alsoclosedborder crossing points with Russia in October 2023, for what it cited as security reasons.',\n",

       "  'content': 'The Prosecutor General of Ukraine, Andriy Kostin,urgedthe International Criminal Court (ICC) on Friday to take up a case against Russia for thestrike on Okhmatdyt Children’s Hospitallast week. The hospital is located in Kyiv and is the largest children’s hospital in Ukraine. It houses the only oncological laboratory in the country. Although hundreds of individuals were evacuated ahead of the strike, some were still in the hospital when it happened. At least 42 civilians were killed, and 190 injured, with the evaluation still ongoing. In addition to the human impact, the attack struck at some of the most vital medical facilities of the country, weakening Ukraine’s capacity to provide quality medical treatment to patients. Many have condemned Russia’s actions as war crimes. The executive director of the Human Rights Watch, Tirana Hassan,saidthat “attacks directed at medical facilities are war crimes under international humanitarian law, and the strike that hit Okhmatdyt children’s hospital should be investigated as a potential war crime.” Further, the director of Okhmatdyt Hospital, Dr. Volodymyr Zhovnir,saidthat “striking a children’s hospital, where children are treated for cancer and other heavy diseases, is not just a war crime, it is far beyond the limits of humanity.” Russia hasdenied any involvementin the strike and said that the strike was a result of Ukrainian missiles veering off course. The ICC ismandatedto investigate and try “individuals charged with the gravest crimes of concern to the international community: genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity and the crime of aggression.”',\n",

       "\"The Constitutional Court of Latvia ruled against a challenge to a law that converts Russian-language schools in Latvia to state that the decision to make Latvian the language of instruction in schools is valid within the country's legal framework and international commitments. Latvia, a former member of the Soviet Union that gained independence and officially became a country in 1991, is liable to its Russian-speaking population, which is a major part of the population. Article 4 of the Constitution of Latvia recognizes Latvian as the official language of the nation, and Article 114 gives the right to ethnic minorities to preserve their language. The Education Law of 1998 and the General Education Law of 2000 require public schools to use Latvian as the primary language of instruction, while private institutions can choose to teach in Russian. In 2018, the amendments to the General Education Law were passed, making teaching in Latvian compulsory in all educational institutions, including private ones, which created controversy among the Russian-speaking population. Opponents of the reform filed a petition in 2023 against the act, alleging it violated the rights to obtain general education in a minority language, but the court upheld the act. The Venice Commission, an advisory body of the Council of Europe, examined the amendments and concluded that the law is in compliance with international regulations governing Latvia. The ruling comes amid other laws passed in Latvia impacting the Russian-speaking community, including regulations requiring Russian residents to pass a Latvian language exam and the closure of border crossing points with Russia in October 2023 for security reasons.\""
